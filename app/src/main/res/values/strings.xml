        \tIn this section we will discuss the logic behind the application\'s main
    functionality displayed in the simulation page.\n
    \tWhen you click the \'run simulation\' button, a number of background processes are
        simultaneously started:\n
        <b>-</b> The <b>lane_add_threads</b> and the
    <b>lane_sub_threads</b> that periodically add and subtract traffic density
        to the lanes at the rate of one density point per second at the intervals
    defined by the user in the simulation settings page.\n
        <b>-</b> The <b>control_traffic_light_thread</b> that periodically sets a specific
        light in the control diagram to orange, green then red in a predefined order at intervals defined by the
        user in the simulation settings page.\n
        <b>-</b> The <b>ai_traffic_light_thread</b> that periodically sets a specific
        light in the adaptable diagram to orange, green then red in a order that is
        decided by the AI algorithm. The algorithm used is the Random Forest Algorithm.
        The AI model is fed a set of density values from all the lanes in the junction
        during the simulation at short intervals. The algorithm then predicts which light
        to turn red/green based on the input. The AI predictions are further processed
        based on some extra parameters such as how long a light has gone without being green.\n
